# Delta Encoding Draft Specification

Delta encoding mechanism to reduce the payload size by only transferring the diff.

### Working with the draft

- Clone the repository, make changes, run 'make update'
- Optionally, for as-you-work updates:
    + run `grunt install`
    + run `grunt` to watch for updates
    + run `grunt exec` to force a build
    + run `grunt gh-pages` to push new draft version to the gh-pages branch
